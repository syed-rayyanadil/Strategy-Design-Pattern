# Strategy-Design-Pattern


When you go to any Supermarket for grocery shopping, after all the grocery has been scanned, most supermarkets ask the customer the kind of shopping bag would they prefer. There are generally three kinds of shopping bags: the regular Plastic shopping bag (Shopper), Paper shopping bag (Recyclable) and Reusable shopping bag (Cotton). Each of these have an additional cost and are completely on the preference of the buyer.

The solution of this problem lies in the Strategy Design Pattern, each of the above mentioned shoppers contribute to a single strategy and therefore we will have three strategies. The customer can use anyone of these strategies, as mentioned above. After the customer has selected, the cashier would then place the groceries in the selected shopping bag and the price of this bag is then added to the overall total (New Total).
